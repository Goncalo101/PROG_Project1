Program in working condition, all goals fulfilled.

Improvements:
-> wordList is now a set, meaning there's automatic sorting and duplicate removal.
    -> Removed unnecessary sorting functions as well as functions to remove duplicates.
-> Created 2 new header files that define important functions for string manipulation and for the word extractor itself.
-> The transition to STL functions greatly improved the execution speed of the program.
-> Functions whose called objects remain unchanged are now called as constant references.
